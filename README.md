# Wheres Wally!
A wheres-wally game that works just as the books are, scans the clicks for positions and references to a database relative to size hosted on firebase, you are timed and if wished can upload their time on the database to get on the leaderboards. This was written in ReactJS with firebase hosting for the database.
